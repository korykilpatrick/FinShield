# FinShield Technical PRD â€“ Overview

**FinShield** is a mobile iOS application that presents a TikTok-like short-form video feed with integrated AI-driven analysis to flag potentially misleading financial content. The application extracts speech from videos, transcribes audio, and leverages third-party AI APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic) to evaluate whether the content is factual or potentially deceptive. Overlays on videos provide users with contextual warnings and educational links.
